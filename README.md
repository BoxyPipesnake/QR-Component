## Overview

This project is a QR component challenge from Frontend Mentor that I completed as part of my practice and learning journey in front-end development. The goal was to build a simple, QR code component, focusing on clean HTML structure and CSS styling. Here, I walk through the steps I took to accomplish the task, including analyzing the design, structuring the HTML, and refining the CSS. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are more than welcome!

## My process
I started by analyzing the Figma design to understand the structure and identify the appropriate semantic elements. Then, I defined class names for these elements.

Next, I set up the HTML code. Before writing any CSS, I imported the fonts and defined variables for colors, standard font sizes, and font weights.

I positioned the elements according to the design, adjusted the wrapper and image containers to apply rounded corners, and finally added the appropriate text shadows to the heading and paragraph. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [text-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) - This resource helped me implement the shadows for the text indicated in the Figma file.
